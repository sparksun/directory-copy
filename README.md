I create this project to copy directories with some custom feature, and I found directory-copy project which Michael Fitzmaurice created in github.com. so I decide to fork this project than create a new wheel.

The only different between Michael Fitzmaurice with my project is:

The copy will ignore same file copy. (same filename and size)

Runtime parameters are same as Michael Fitzmaurice project:

    primary-file-type source-directory target-directory secondary-file-types-list
